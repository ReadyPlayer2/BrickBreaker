# BrickBreaker
Brick Breaker Game in pure JavaScript. That's right, no frameworks...(I think?!)

A little project to learn some JavaScript and git - following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0

### Clone
`git clone https://github.com/ReadyPlayer2/BrickBreaker`

### Host
Host project files using http-server (`npm install http-server`) then just run `http-server` using command line in the project directory.

### Play
Browse to `localhost:8080` to play the game. During development a hard-refersh of the webpage is often required to pick up changes.

Only tested in Chrome 71.

#### Notes for noobs
