# BrickBreaker
Brick Breaker Game in pure JavaScript. That's right, no frameworks...(I think?!)

A little project to learn some JavaScript - following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0

Host project files using http-server (`npm install http-server`) then just run http-server using command line in the project directory.

Browse to `http://192.168.1.226:8080/index.html` to play the game. During development a hard-refersh of the webpage is required to pick up changes.

Only tested in Chrome 71.
