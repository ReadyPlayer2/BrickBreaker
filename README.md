# BrickBreaker
Brick Breaker game in pure JavaScript. That's right, no frameworks...(yet..)

A little project to learn some JavaScript and git - following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0 and then some improvements.

### Clone
`git clone https://github.com/ReadyPlayer2/BrickBreaker`

### Host
Host project files using http-server (`npm install http-server`) then just run `http-server` using command line in the project directory.

### Play
Browse to `localhost:8080` to play the game. During development a hard-refresh of the webpage is often required to pick up changes.

Only tested in Chrome 71.

#### Notes for noobs
`git status`    
`git add fileName`  
`git commit -m "change comment"`  
`git push -u origin master`  
`git checkout -- fileName`
